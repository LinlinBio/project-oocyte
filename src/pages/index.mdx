## Abstract

This is a live demo for a template you can use to create a simple project page for your research paper. See the code for the template and instructions on how to use it yourself [here](https://github.com/RomanHauksson/academic-project-astro-template). It's made with the [Astro web framework](https://astro.build/) and styled with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). You write the content in [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/), which enables markdown formatting like **bold**, _italics_, and ~strikethrough~, as well as custom components like <SmallCaps>small caps.</SmallCaps>

## Introduction

CCB02 was identified and optimized to selectively bind to the CPAP-binding site on tubulin, thereby competitively inhibiting the interaction between CPAP and tubulin, allowing CPAP to recruit greater amounts of its other interacting proteins, such as pericentriolar material (PCM), to interphase centrosomes. This disrupts normal centrosome clustering, activates the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), and ultimately prevents cell division.

However, mouse oocyte meiosis relies on a centrosome-independent mechanism of spindle assembly, in which CPAP does not localize to the spindle. To better understand this process, we investigated the effect of CCB02 during mouse oocyte meiosis. Our results showed that mouse oocyte meiosis was inhibited by CCB02 in a dose-dependent manner, providing new insights into the regulation of spindle assembly during oogenesis.

## Methods

GV-stage mouse oocytes were isolated and treated with gradient concentrations of CCB02 (0 mM, 2.5 mM, 5 mM, and 10 mM) for 7 h, followed by fixation, immunofluorescence staining, and confocal microscopy imaging.

## Results

Oocytes treated with a low concentration of CCB02 (2.5 mM) for 7 h progressed to GVBD, whereas those treated with a high concentration (10 mM) remained at the GV stage; in both conditions, spindle assembly was defective.

Increasing CCB02 concentration slowed oocyte development, raising the proportion of cells at earlier meiotic stages.
